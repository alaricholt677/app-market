## Integrity and Safety of irl.zip

### Official Distribution

**https://alaricholt677.github.io/downloads/irl.zip**

### Verification
To ensure the file you downloaded has not been tampered with by third parties, you **must** verify the SHA-256 hash.

**Official SHA-256 Hash:**

## Security Philosophy
- **Data Privacy:** This project does not collect, share, or sell user data. The game requires only a local player name for the internal logic. No public accounts or telemetry are used.
- **Transparency:** The project is a private hobbyist engine. By providing checksums for official releases, I am committed to maintaining the integrity of the files I can gareentee safety for so far.
